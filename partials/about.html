                <em>Hi, I’m Diana.</em> I am a <em>full stack UX designer</em>, rom Montana, passionate about education technology, social justice, and cats. I have called Seattle home for five years, taking inspiration from the culture of resilience, creativity, and collaboration that surrounds me. When I am not designing, you can find me rock climbing, designing and DMing my Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign, or volunteer mentoring in my community’s preschool for homeless youth, <em><a href="http://www.firstplaceschool.org/">First Place</a></em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will soon graduate from the Informatics department at the University of Washington, and will be available for hire Summer / Fall 2017. <em><a href="contact.html">Reach out</a></em> to me if you would like to work together.
